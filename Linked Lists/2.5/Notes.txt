Notes

.size() is used to get the length of a LinkedList

Below is an example of computing the sum of two numbers didgit by didgit.
This will only work when the didgits are read in forward order, not reverse.

for (int i = 0; i < firstOperand.size(); i++) {
	result *= 10;
	result += firstOperand.get(i) + secondOperand.get(i);
}
