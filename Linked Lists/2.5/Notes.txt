Notes

When working with a problem like this the size of the numbers to be added may be an issue.
If didgits are in reverse order this can be solved recursivly.
If digits are in forward order padding is required.

.size() is used to get the length of a LinkedList

Below is an example of computing the sum of two numbers didgit by didgit.
This will only work when the didgits are read in forward order, not reverse.

for (int i = 0; i < firstOperand.size(); i++) {
	result *= 10;
	result += firstOperand.get(i) + secondOperand.get(i);
}
