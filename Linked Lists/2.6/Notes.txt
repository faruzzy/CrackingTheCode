Notes

To detect a collision in a linked list we use two pointers.
The first pointer has a jump size of one. 
The second pointer has a jump size of two.
If they meet before the list ends then a loop occurs in the list.

To detect where a loop occurs in a list we use two pointers.
The first pointer has a jump size of one.
The second pointer has a jump size of two.
When they meet we reset the first pointer to the head of the list.
We set the jump size of the first pointer to one.
When they meet again this is where the start of the loop occurs in the list.
