Design an in memory FileSystem. Explain the datastructures and algorithms you would use 
to design the system.

A FileSystem is made of files and directories. Each directory contains a set of files and
more directories. Since files and directories share a lot of characteristics we could implement
them to extend a superclass that shares the common properties.

Lessons Learned: 

- Override all abstract methods
- System.currentTimeMillis() can be used to get the current time in milliseconds
- "instance of" is a great run time check for detecting if a class is of a certain type
- After performing an instance of check it is typical to cast to the type detected
