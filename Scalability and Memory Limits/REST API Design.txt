Here's a few quick notes regarding REST API design.

1. Use HTTP methods explicitly
2. Be stateless
3. Expose directory structure like URIs
4. Transfer JSON or XML

Being stateless helps improve performance. Servers don't have to retrieve state or context
before servicing a request. Also all information required to generate a response to a request
is contained within the request itself.

Being stateless makes caching easier and off loads this responsibility to the client. A field
can be added to the HTTP Response header specifing whether a client should cache a page for future
use.
