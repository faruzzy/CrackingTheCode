Notes

- import java.util.ArrayList for an array list
- import java.util.Stack for a stack

This will perform a pop on a given stack but will not perform rollover. This is to improve
the time complexity of pop over large datasets. If roll over were implemented then
items would have to be shifted across stacks. As is SetOfStacks is capable of correctly managing
stack indexes and sizes after a popAt(index) call.
