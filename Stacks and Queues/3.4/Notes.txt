The key to this problem is in the pseduocode.

First we want to move n-1 disks from origin to buffer using destination as a buffer.
Then we want to move the remaining disk from origin to destination.
Lastly we want to remove the remaning n-1 disks from buffer to destination using origin as a buffer.

moveDisks(int numberOfDisks, Tower source, Tower buffer, Tower destination) {
	
	if (numberOfDisks <= 0) return;

	moveDisks(n-1, source, destination, buffer);

	moveTop(origin, destination)

	moveDisks(n-1, buffer, origin, destination);
}
