Notes

One approach to using a single array to implement three stacks is to have three fixed length stacks. 
The downside of this approach is that if one stack gets full we can't allocate any more space to it.

A more complicated approach would be to dynamically resize the stacks as they grow. This would involves shifting elements in the array and likely using a circular buffer.

- If method throws an exception then you must have try/catch block or declare that the
  method throws an exception.
