- java.util.LinkedList.size() is used to get the size of a LinkedList
- We can iterate through a string of linked lists using fast enumeration
- An abstract class can not be instantiated but may contain method definitions
  that the subclasses is allowed to call

 Note that we could have reduced the run time of dequeue cat and dequeue dog by maintaining two separate
 queues and associating a time stamp with each animal. On a dequeueAny() we would then peak at both
 heads of each list and pop the oldest.
