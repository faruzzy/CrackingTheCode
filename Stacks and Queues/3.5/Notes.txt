Notes

- We could have implemented this better using a lazy approach. We don't need to constantly
  copy elements back and forth between stacks. Only when the second dequeueing stack is empty
  is it nessicary to copy elements over from the queueing stack.

Stack.isEmpty() can be used to check if java.util.Stack has elements
