Notes

This problem used a special property when dealing with rotations.

The property is as follows:

- A rotation occurs around as specific point, namely z.
  This means that the first part of the string, call it x, is from 0 to z.
  The remaining part of the string, call it y, is from z to the end of the string.

- The rotated string is yx where as the original is xy

Now to check for a rotation we can use isSubstring on xyxy since this the original word repeated twice.

Since a rotation is just the latter half of the word followed by the former half, calling is isSubstring
on the word repeated will return whether or not the string in question is a rotation.
