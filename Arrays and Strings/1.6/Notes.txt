Notes

This question was very hard and was typed up from solutions. Below are some lessons learned.

- Implement the rotation in layers, work with the top half of the matrix
- Perform a circular clockwise rotation
- Perform swap index by index starting with the outtermost layer and working your way inwards
- Algorithm will operate in O(n^2) since we must touch all elements

- You can get the length of a 2D matrix column simply by doing matrix.length
- You can get the length of a 2D matrix row simply by doing matrix[0].length
- 2D matrix is [row][column]
