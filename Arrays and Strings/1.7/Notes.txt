Notes

- Be careful when setting a variable equal to a reference vs an actual value
- To get the length of a row we can do matrix.length
- To get the length of a column we can do matrix[0].length
- Matrix is specified in terms of row then columns
- Bit vector is more space efficient than a boolean array, although both
  accomplish the same task
