Notes

- Remember to check error cases and return or throw exceptions accordingly
- To parse an integer from command line arguments we must use Integer.parse()
- A hardcoded char must be in single quotes not double quotes.
- Java Strings are immutable, even a replace operation results in a new String being created

// Correct
Char a = 'a';

// Incorrect
Char a = "a";
