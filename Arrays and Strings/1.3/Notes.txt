Notes

- java.util.Sort(Array) can be used to sort an array
- Be conservative about allocating char[], you can usually work the string itself
- String.charAt(index) can be used to access a character in a String

The questions below determine the size of the character array.

- Ask about the character set, ASCII vs. Unicode
- Ask if whitespace matters
- As if capitalization matters

You can perform fast enumeration per character of a string.

for (Char c : String.toCharArray()) {
	
}
