Notes

String.valueOf(int) will return the string representation of an int.

Character.forDigit(int) will return the char representation of an int. 
Note that this is limited to digits 0 through 9.

StringBuffers are really good for building strings. Much better than
character arrays. No need to manage indexes. StringBuffer can also
handle any size int input, no need for Character.forDigit(int).

We can convert from char to int easily but not int to char.
